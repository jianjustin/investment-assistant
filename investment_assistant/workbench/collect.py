"""Per-ticker collectors shared by the batch and the screen stage.

Each function owns exactly one fetch -> normalize -> store step and its own
transaction (``service._tx``), so every caller keeps its try/except and its
summary writes where they are. Exceptions always propagate unchanged.

The rest of this module is the fetch-run bookkeeping the batch and the manual
fetch feed (v2.3 §6): the per-family Tally, the append-only write, and the
per-family advisory locks.

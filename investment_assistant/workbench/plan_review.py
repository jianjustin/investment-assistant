"""The daily review stage `review`, the per-chain review use case, the manual recheck, the chain read views
and the ``plan_review`` command line (v2.5 spec §7, §8.2, §12; `stages-2`; v2.9 spec §4, §7).

After the agent stage, every reviewable chain (state ``entry`` or ``holding`` under `timeline-2`, v2.9 R10; an
``exiting`` chain is only listed, its holding status is all it gets) is reviewed once per trading day S: the host
first (a holding chain's stop touched or time stop, then any met invalidation condition, invalidates, D8, D18; a
quiet day with no signal, no new user input and no met review condition maintains, D9), then — inside the
budget gates — one ``agent-review-2`` call, and a revision (proposal + counter + checks, ``mode = 'revise'``)
when the review says ``revise``. An entry chain a unit just merged into (``retrigger`` signal) skips the
single-phase review and goes straight to the revision (D4). Every outcome is one ``plan_reviews`` row; after all
reviews every held ticker gets one ``holding_status`` row, whatever happened to its review (D19).

Transactions: the chain's facts are read in one short transaction holding the chain's advisory lock; the
model runs with no transaction open; everything the review produces (review run, revise run, plan row,
version row, review row) is written in ONE transaction that takes the lock again and re-checks that the
head did not move (a recheck may have written a version meanwhile → ``review_in_progress``, no row).
A busy lock (a recheck running on the chain) skips the chain without a row.

On top of that, the whole review of one chain — read, model calls, write — runs under a session-level
advisory lock ``review-run:<ticker>:<signal_date>`` held on a connection of its own (``_run_lock``), so a
batch review, a recheck and a second recheck of the same chain never run their model calls side by side:
the later one skips (batch, no row) or is a 409 (recheck). The key differs from the transaction-level write
lock, so the review's own write transaction on another connection is not blocked by it.

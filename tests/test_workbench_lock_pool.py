"""Real-pool advisory-lock lifecycle tests (final review I01).

``family_locks`` and the manual fetch release their session locks through a
pooled connection: exiting the context returns the session to the pool instead
of closing it, so any lock surviving the exit leaks onto the next borrower —
and because session locks are re-entrant, the same session would "succeed" at
re-acquiring while other processes stay locked out. These tests use a real
``psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool`` (max_size=1) and a second physical session to
prove the locks are really gone, per the review's reproduction recipe.
